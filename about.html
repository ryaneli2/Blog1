    <p>Hi! My name is Lizzy Ryan and I am a Senior at Michigan State University. My major is in Information Science with a focus in Human Centered Technology and a minor in Information Technology. I chose to come to MSU due to the family that lived in the area at the time so I could be independent from my childhood home but also be close to family that I missed seeing in my highschool years. As you can probably tell from this blog and its posts I love food, reading, and videogames, if three words could sum me up it would probably be them. My mom taught me how to cook from a young age and I worked in a diner as a cook last summer and it was one of the best experiences I have ever had. I grew up reading and I like to think, video games go hand and hand with that as I like to think of them as immersive story books with puzzles that need solving along the way. </p>
